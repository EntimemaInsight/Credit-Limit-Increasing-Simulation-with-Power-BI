# Credit-Limit-Increasing-Simulation-with-Power-Bi

This project is a simulation of how credit limits can be increased using Power BI. It aims to show how a company can analyze and track their customers' creditworthiness and use that data to increase their credit limits. The simulation uses an Excel data source, and the analysis is presented in a dashboard using Power BI.

## Usage

The data used in this project is entirely fictional and intended solely for demonstration purposes. The data represents a credit card limit increasing simulation.

## Excel Sources

The Excel data source used in this simulation contains information about the customers of a company, including their credit scores, credit limits, and payment history. The data is organized into several tables, including:

1. 	Customers: It contains client information
2.	Credit Scores: It contains the credit scores of each customer, as reported by a credit bureau.
3.	Credit Limits: It contains the current credit limits of each customer.
4.	Payment History: It contains information about each customer's payment history, including the date of each payment and the amount paid.

## Dashboard

The dashboard in this simulation includes several filters and diagrams that help to visualize the data and the analysis.

## Credit Limit Filters

The Credit Limit Filters allow the user to select the credit limit increase amount and which clients to view. The options are:

- 200 eur increase
- 300 eur increase
- 400 eur increase
- All clients

## Diagrams 

The diagrams in the dashboard shows two scenarios: the Transactional Amount Growth Scenario and the Revenue Dynamics Scenario. The Actual and Projection lines are displayed for each scenario, showing the growth in transactional amount and revenue over time. 

The projections are generated using MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ANALISYS based on customer data, such as credit scores, payment history, and credit limits. 
For example, the company might use MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ANALISYS to determine the factors that have the greatest impact on a customer's creditworthiness, and then use that information to make decisions about increasing their credit limit.
Suppose that the company conducts a MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ANALISYS using customer data and finds that credit score, payment history, and credit utilization are the most important factors in determining creditworthiness. Based on this analysis, they might use Power BI to develop a simulation that predicts the likelihood of a customer having their credit limit increased based on their credit score, payment history, and credit utilization.

## Key Insights

Some key insights that can be drawn from this simulation include:

1. Credit scores, payment history, and credit utilization are important factors in determining a customer's creditworthiness.
2. Customers with higher credit scores and payment history are more creditworthy and generate more revenue for the company.
3. Multiple Regression Analysis can be used to forecast revenue growth and transactional amount growth based on customer data.
4. By using the filters in the dashboard, the company can select which clients to view and adjust credit limits accordingly.
5. The dashboard provides a visual representation of the company's customers and their creditworthiness, making it easier for decision-makers to understand the data.
