# Credit-Limit-Increasing-Simulation-with-Power-Bi

This project is a simulation of how credit limits can be increased using Power BI. It aims to show how a company can analyze and track their customers' creditworthiness and use that data to increase their credit limits. The simulation uses an Excel data source, and the analysis is presented in a dashboard using Power BI.

## Excel Sources

The Excel data source used in this simulation contains information about the customers of a company, including their credit scores, credit limits, and payment history. The data is organized into several tables, including:

1. 	Customers: It contains client information
2.	Credit Scores: It contains the credit scores of each customer, as reported by a credit bureau.
3.	Credit Limits: It contains the current credit limits of each customer.
4.	Payment History: It contains information about each customer's payment history, including the date of each payment and the amount paid.
